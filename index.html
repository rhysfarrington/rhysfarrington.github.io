    <h2><u>What I like about apple juice:</u></h2>

    <p>
        - It's not as sharp as orange juice<br />
        - It never has bits in it<br />
        - It still tastes good after being watered down<br />
        - It goes with a lot of food
    </p>

    <h2><u>What don't I like about apple juice:</u></h2>

    <p>
        - It's probably not that healthy for you with all that sugar<br />
        - It always comes <i>way</i> too strong so I need to water it down
